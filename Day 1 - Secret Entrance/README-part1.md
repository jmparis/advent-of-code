# Safe Dial Rotation Simulator
A Python program that simulates rotating a safe dial with numbers 0-99.


## How It Works
- The dial has numbers 0 through 99 arranged in a circle
- Starting position: **50**
- **R** (Right): Rotate clockwise toward higher numbers
- **L** (Left): Rotate counterclockwise toward lower numbers
- The dial wraps around: 99 + 1 = 0, and 0 - 1 = 99


## Input Format
Create an `input.txt` file with one rotation per line:
